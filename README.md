## Overview:

As of right now, the application currently creates playlists in 2 possible manners. 
1. o4-mini will do it's best to come up with a playlist based on the users criteria, and then we query spotify for those tracks, resulting in a 10 song playlist.
   - i.e. "make me a playlist for a sunny spring day, and be sure to include some soft indie rock!"
2. if the user specifically requests a playlist of a favorite artist of theirs, we filter and query spotify on that artist only, resulting in a max 100 song playlist.
   - i.e. "make me a playlist of my favorite artist Billie Eilish"
